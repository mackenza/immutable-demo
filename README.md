# immutable-demo

This repo is a set of examples and demos for use in my talk about Immutable Javascript Collections at the June 10, 2015 Meetup of the Ottawa Javascript group.

### Using the repo
1. clone the repo locally: `git clone https://github.com/mackenza/immutable-demo`
1. `cd immutable-demo`
1. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
1. *optional* - install the [Nesh REPL](http://danielgtaylor.github.io/nesh/) I used in the session to allow you to play around with the code interactively. `npm install -g nesh`

The code was intended to be run in a console via NodeJS. I suppose it can easily be adapted to run in a browser, but I have not done anything to make that work.
It's up to you.
